## About The Game

This project is a classic endless runner inspired by games like *Subway Surfers*. The player character runs forward automatically, and the objective is to survive as long as possible by avoiding randomly generated obstacles. The game features a progressively increasing speed, a scoring system based on collected coins, and a lively, procedurally generated urban environment.
